# Reviews Site
## Overview
Create a reviews site that categorizes reviews. Create reviews about anything you like: tech, travel, toys, they’re all good.

Create a Spring Boot + MVC app that displays a list of reviews, allowing us to click on an individual review to see its details.

## Tasks
## Required Tasks
* Create/configure a Spring Boot/MVC application.
* Create a Review class for the content of reviews. Its instance variables (attributes) should include:
  * id (make this of type long – you’ll find out why later) – just use arbitrary, unique numbers for these ids
  * title
  * image url
  * review category
  * content
  * whatever other things you’d like to include. Some ideas:
    * date
    * description/synopsis
* Create a ReviewRepository class
  * This class should be annotated properly so that it can be injected into ReviewsController.
  * It should have a constructor that creates your Review instances and populates a Map that stores your reviews, using each review’s id as the map key.
  * It should have a method to find all reviews
  * It should have a method to find one review by id
* Create a ReviewsController class.
   * apply proper annotation
  * It should inject…something appropriately
  * It should have a method mapped to a url that puts all of your reviews into the model, forwarding to a “reviews” template.
  * It should have a method mapped to a url including an id parameter that puts one of your reviews into the model, forwarding to a “review” template. This method should expect an “id” query parameter in order to select a specific review.
* Place images you use into your src/main/resources/static/images folder and link to them there. Example: if your image is in src/main/resources/static/images/foo.jpg, you would reference it in your application as /images/foo.jpg.

* Use your html/css-fu to style to your pages consistently and to make them appealing.
